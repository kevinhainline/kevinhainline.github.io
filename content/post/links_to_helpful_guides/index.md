Here are some guides that I wrote to help with using the OSMOS spectrograph on the MDM
2 meter telescope, and then for using IRAF to reduce data from OSMOS and SALT RSS. 

[**An Introduction to IRAF**](https://mips.as.arizona.edu/~khainline/intro_to_IRAF.html)

[**Long-slit Observing with OSMOS**](https://mips.as.arizona.edu/~khainline/osmos_proc.html)

[**OSMOS Long-slit Data Reduction**](https://mips.as.arizona.edu/~khainline/osmos_redux.html)

[**SALT RSS Long-slit Data Reduction**](https://mips.as.arizona.edu/~khainline/salt_redux.html)
