So, relativity is a tricky subject, that requires hours of careful thought, an open mind, and a dark room to slowly cry in case it gets too confusing. This short guide is intended to clear up some of the weirder ideas in an attempt to clarify what is admittedly a completely crazy (some might even say "made-up") subject. I assure you, however, that this is all real science, and while it does sound insane, it is backed by scientific evidence. Ok! On to the science.

Relativity is split up into two subjects:

1. Special Relativity
2. General Relativity
