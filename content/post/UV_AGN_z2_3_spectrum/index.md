In [Hainline et al. (2011)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...733...31H), we presented a rest-frame UV composite spectrum for a 
sample of UV-selected AGNs from the Lyman-break galaxy sample at z~2-3.

Column 1 has rest-frame wavelength in Angstroms, while Column 2 has units of L_nu, 
in erg/s/Hz. This is an updated version from Hainline et al. (2011) made with 
luminosity units.
