Recently, the JADES team discovered a galaxy at a remarkable redshift of 14.32, [JADES-GS-z14-0](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/early-highlights/nasas-james-webb-space-telescope-finds-most-distant-known-galaxy).
This galaxy is so distant that we're seeing it when the Universe was only 290 Million years old. 

To celebrate this discovery, the Space Telescope Science Institute has created a simulated 
flythrough to the galaxy, using actual observations, images, and estimated redshifts for
the sources in JADES.
