abstract: By combining the JWST/NIRCam JADES and CEERS extragalactic datasets, we have uncovered a sample of twenty-one T and Y brown dwarf candidates at best-fit distances between 0.1 - 4.2 kpc. These sources were selected by targeting the blue 1 - 2.5 micron colors and red 3 - 4.5 micron colors that arise from molecular absorption in the atmospheres of Teff <<> 1300K brown dwarfs. We fit these sources using multiple models of substellar atmospheres and present the resulting fluxes, sizes, effective temperatures and other derived properties for the sample. If confirmed, these fits place the majority of the sources in the Milky Way thick disk and halo. We observe proper motion for seven of the candidate brown dwarfs with directions in agreement with the plane of our Galaxy, providing evidence that they are not extragalactic in nature. We demonstrate how the colors of these sources differ from selected high-redshift galaxies, and explore the selection of these sources in planned large-area JWST NIRCam surveys. Deep imaging with JWST/NIRCam presents an an excellent opportunity for finding and understanding these ultracool dwarfs at kpc distances.
