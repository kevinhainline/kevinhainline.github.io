#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Kevin Hainline is an astronomer at Steward Observatory at University of Arizona. He is a member of the JWST NIRCam Science Team, helping with testing and commissioning the primary camera on board the observatory. His research explores the ultra high redshift universe, supermassive black holes and their host galaxies, and infrared selection of cold brown dwarfs. He is also an advocate for science outreach education and public speaking. He's very enthusiastic.
