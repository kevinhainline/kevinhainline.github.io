JADES Extragalactic Ultra-deep Artificial Realization (JAGUAR) is a new empirical model of the evolution of galaxy properties driven entirely by observations over the redshift range 0.2 < z < 10 (Williams et al. 2018). Using this model we have built a suite of mock galaxy catalogs designed for the new era of extragalactic deep field surveys using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), including realistic extrapolations to z < 15 and down to the expected JWST detection limits.
